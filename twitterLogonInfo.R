# Reminder: you have to create an "app" so that you can connect to the API.
# (You're not really creating an app, it's more of just a connection
# point.) If you still have your info from before, that's fine, you don't need
# to create another app.
#
# To create an app and get the info:
#
# Go to http://dev.twitter.com, and make an account if you don't have one.
#
#   Click on "Manage your Apps" at the very bottom.
#
#   Create a New App. Important: the "Callback URL" must be this
#   (copy/paste it): http://127.0.0.1:1410
#
#   When the app is created, you should be able to go to a "Keys and
#   Access Tokens" tab. The two pieces of info you need are:
#
#   1. the "key" (also called "consumer key")
#   2. the "secret" (also called "consumer secret")
#
# Paste those below.

key <- ""
secret <- ""
